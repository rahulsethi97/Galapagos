Your dynasty had control of the island several centuries ago and through magical visions you’ve discovered of its ability to produce some very powerful cards. While your family was in control of the island, these cards were used as tools to advance civilization, and their usage was limited to the island. However, in recent times, invaders have taken control of the island and are using the cards for their illicit businesses.
